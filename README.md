# X Community Studio

## Description

X Community Studio is a dynamic space that offers a wide range of services to its
visitors and community members. This includes communal areas, auditoriums,
meeting rooms, co-working spaces, and a cafe. They provide access to the various
spaces according to subscription based memberships, one-time bookings, and
under an all-access “day pass” system for individuals. The cafe is open for the
general public. X Community Studio sometimes organizes special events that are
open to the general public through registrations. There is also a corporate office
within the premises where outsiders may meet with members of the team to either
learn about the services on offer, and for B2B collaboration purposes.
